The VS Code API (Application Programming Interface) allows extension authors to interact with and control various aspects of the Visual Studio Code editor. It provides a set of JavaScript modules and interfaces that give access to functionality such as:

- Manipulating editor content
- Creating and modifying editor views
- Accessing commands and menus
- Registering event listeners
- Running tasks

With the VS Code API, extensions can add new features, modify existing ones, and integrate with external tools and services.

You can find more information about the API in the [documentation](/modules/vscode.html):

> The API list is compiled from [vscode.d.ts](https://github.com/youngjuning/vscode-api/blob/main/vscode.d.ts) file using Typedoc, if [vscode.d.ts source File](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/src/vscode-dts/vscode.d.ts) has been updated, we will synchronize in time, the current corresponding commit is b19d36f.
